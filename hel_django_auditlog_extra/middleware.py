    Middleware to ensure the correct actor is logged in audit logs.

    This middleware extends the `auditlog.middleware.AuditlogMiddleware` to
    address a potential issue where the actor (user and their IP address)
    might not be available when `auditlog` attempts to access it.

    It achieves this by explicitly setting the actor in the
    audit log context before the request is processed. This ensures that
    audit logs accurately reflect the user responsible for each action.

    This fix is based on the suggestion provided in:
    https://github.com/jazzband/django-auditlog/issues/115#issuecomment-1682234986

    Additionally, this middleware sets the request path in the audit log
    context, providing more context for each logged action.
