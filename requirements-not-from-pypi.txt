# This file is only for packages that are not available from PyPI,
# i.e. ones installed using "-e" option / editable packages.
#
# Other packages can be put into the *.in files, but editable packages
# can not be used as constraints, see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8210
#
# Because requirements-dev.in includes requirements.txt as a constraint
# using "-c requirements.txt" an editable package can not be put into it
# or its source file requirements.in.
